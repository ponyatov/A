\secrel{Extension Libraries and Loading Other Image Formats}

SDL only supports .bmp files natively, but using the SDL\_image extension
library, you'll be able to load BMP, PNM, XPM, LBM, PCX, GIF, JPEG, TGA and PNG
files.

Extension libraries allow you to use features that basic SDL doesn't support
natively. Setting up an SDL extension library isn't hard at all, I'd even say
it's easier to set up than basic SDL. This tutorial will teach you how to use
the SDL\_image extension library.
