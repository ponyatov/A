% 3.5 Making Negative Printouts
% Eagle is straight forward at producing printouts for a positive photographic pcb making process.
% (NOTE THE TEXT ON THE PCB APPEARS
% REVERSED THIS IS CORRECT)
% If your photosensitive board
% requires a negative image
% such as this, another stage on
% the process is required..
% 
% 3.5.1 Other software
% required
% The following software is required to manipulate the
% special CAM (computer aided manufacturing) files
% created by Eagle (and other pcb CAD software) into
% the printed image you require. All this software is
% shareware with no fees attached for its use by
% students.
% * Install GhostScript - from http://www.ghostscript.com
% * Install GSView - from http://www.ghostgum.com.au/
% Conversion process
% This process creates a '.ps' (postscript file), it is the best output from Eagle to use. It will keep the
% board exactly the same and correct size for printing.
% * Open yourboard.brd in Eagle
% * From within the Eagle Board Editor start the CAM Processor
% * select device as PS_INVERTED
% * Scale = 1
% * file = .ps
% * make sure fill pads is NOT selected this
% makes small drill holes in the acetate which
% we use to line up the drill with when drilling
% * for layers select only 16,17,18 and 20,
% * make sure ALL other layers are NOT
% selected.
% * Select process job
% * if you will use this process a lot save this
% cam setup as so that you can reuse it again
% Open the TDA2822verA.ps file with
% Ghostview for printing and print it onto an over
% head transparency. Make sure you can see
% the drill holes!
