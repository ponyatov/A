2.7 Switch assignment

Find a small switch and carefully disassemble it (take it apart) draw how it
works and explain its operation. Make sure you explain the purpose of the
spring(s).

Here are simplified drawings of a small slide switch when it is in both
positions. When the switch is on electricity can flow, when it is open the
circuit is broken.
