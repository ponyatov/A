The LED requires 2V the battery is 9V, if you put the LED across the battery it
would stop working! So a 1k (1000ohm) resistor is used to reduce the voltage to
the LED and the current through it, get a multimeter and measure the voltage
across the resistor, is it close to 7V? If you disconnect any wire within the
circuit it stops working, a circuit needs to be complete before electrons can
flow.
