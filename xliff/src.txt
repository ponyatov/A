2.1 Where to buy stuff?

In New Zealand there are a number of reasonably
priced and excellent suppliers for components including
www.surplustronics.co.nz and
www.activecomponents.com. Overseas suppliers I use
include www.digikey.co.nz, www.sparkfun.com
ebay.com & aliexpress.com

A breadboard is a plastic block with holes and metal
connection strips inside it to make circuits. The holes
are arranged so that components can be connected
together to form circuits. The top and bottom rows are
usually used for power, top for positive which is red and
the bottom for negative which is black.

This circuit could be built like this, note that the LED
must go around the correct way. If you have the LED and resistor connected in a closed circuit
the LED should light up.
